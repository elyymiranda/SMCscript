# This is the input for generating the modified orbitals from a SMC pseudo-spectrum analysis (script_p).

# After the begin you should put the number of orbitals, orbital number (obtained from pseudo-spectrum) and the coefficient of the choosen orbital. Each state required will ocupy one line, as a show here in the exemple:

#BEGIN
# Number of orb.        Orb. Numb.   Coeff.       Orb. Numb.   Coeff.       Orb. Numb.   Coeff.       Orb. Numb.   Coeff.       Orb. Numb.   Coeff.       Orb. Numb.   Coeff.       
# 2                     35           -0.6         38           0.4
# 3                     36            0.4         37           0.7          38           0.3
#END

# Now, it is your turn. Remember to not leave empty lines between the begin and end (as the exemple above)

 BEGIN
3 30  0.44 31 -0.69 33 -0.35
2 30 -0.80 31 -0.37
3 31  0.48 33 -0.59 36  0.39
2 32  0.46 34 -0.34
2 38  0.42 40  0.36
3 33  0.38 34 -0.32 36  0.46
1 32  0.48
